# Test files

1. GeneralTest - Validates the integrity of textfiles and constants

The main bulk of testing was done in the development phase by judging the
graphical output, and since the project is heavily graphic, it is difficult to test it otherwise in a meaningful manner.

As you can see, virtually all of the significant methods and variables are
private, and thus, we have no access to them in the tests.
